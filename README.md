# Fitness-Tracker

* This is a fitness application so that you can keep track of your daily workouts. This app allows you to focus on your progress, by showing you the results of your workout in the form of a graph. Over time, you can keep track of how well you are doing and what workouts work best for you. This web application will allow you to enter in information about your workouts online and offline if you don't have temporary internet access.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Operation

* Below you will see the first screen that will allow you to create an entry for a new workout or continue a current workout. You even have the option to click on the Dashboard to see your results or the Fitness Tracker to enter in more workouts.
